Mitsuha
Once in a while when I wake up
I find myself crying
The dream I must have had
I can never recall
But...But...
The sensation that I've lost something
lingers for a long time after I wake up
I am always searching
for something, for someone
This feeling has possessed me
I think from that day...
The day when the stars came falling
It was almost as if...
as if a scene from a dream
Nothing more, Nothing less
than a beautiful view.



Mitsuha, What are you doing?
Well, It feels incredibly realistic...
What? "Mitsuha"?
Are you half asleep? Breakfast!
Hurry up!
What? What?
Do you want last night's leftovers?
You can have it.
Good morning.
Mitsuha, you are late!
I will make breakfast tomorrow.
Is this too much?
Oh, well.
You are normal today.
You were nuts yesterday.
What are you talking about?
Good morining, everyone.
This is an announcement from Itomori Town Hall.
Regarding the mayoral election,
to be held on the 20th next month, the election committee...
A comet with an orbital period of 1200 years will pass by in a month.
The comet will be visible to the naked eys for several days...
Just make it up with him.
It is an adult's matter.
"Position of Comet Timat"
JAXA are preparing to observe the celestial show of the century.
"Closest on October 4th."
We're going now!
Study hard!
Mitsuha
Morning, Sayaka, Tessie.
Morning
Get off, Why? Meanie.
You're heavy.
That is rude.
You two get along so well.
We do not!
Your hair looks all right today.




I'd rather do that too.
You're not ready yet, Yotsuha.
Listen to the thread's voice.
When you keep twining like that,
emotions will eventually start flowing between you and the thread.
Threads don't talk.
She means "concentrate."
1000 years of Itomori's history is etched into our braided cords.
Listen, 200 years ago...
Here she goes again.
Sandal make Mayugoro's bathroom caught on fire and burned down this whole area.
The shrine and old documents were destroyed.
and this is known as...
The Great Fire of Mayugoro.
The fire has his name? Poor Mayugoro.
So the meaning of our festivals became unknown and only the form lived on.
But even if words was lost, tradition should be handed down.
That's the important task we at Miyamizu Shrine have.
But that foolish son-in-law...
As if leaving Shinto priesthood and this house weren't enough,
now politics? He is hopeless.
Have another, my man.
I'm counting on your help again.
Leave it to me.
You'll get votes from the Kadoiri and Sakagami Districts.
How's it going with her?
It's not that easy.
I smell corruption.
Dot't be ridiculous.
Bring us a few more hot sake.
Ok.
Katsuhiko, work on site this weekend.
Learn how to use explosives.
Can't hear you.
Yes!
We both have it rough, don't we?
Is that Yotsuha? She's all grown up.
They're both pretty like their mother.
Hey.
Hey.
It's the oldest sake in the world.
By chewing on rice, spitting it out, and letting it ferment, it becomes alcohol.
"Kuchikamisake." Do the gods appreciate sake made that way?
Of course they do.
Hey, look, It's Miyamizu.
Oh! I could never do that!
Isn't she embarrassed?
I can't believe it.
Cheer up, Mitsuha, Who cares if a few classmates saw you?
I envy you pre-pubescent lack of concern.
Why not sell lots of Kuchikamisake and use the money to go to Tokyo?
Where do you get such ideas?
Sell them with photos and making videos, Name it "Shrine Maiden's Sake"
You will make money!
No, That breaks the Liguor Tax Law.
That is the problem?
I hate this town! I hate this life!
Please make me a handsome Tokyo boy in my next lift!
What a fool...
