Mitsuha
Once in a while when I wake up
I find myself crying
The dream I must have had
I can never recall
But...But...
The sensation that I've lost something
lingers for a long time after I wake up
I am always searching
for something, for someone
This feeling has possessed me
I think from that day...
The day when the stars come falling
It was almost as if...
as if a scene from a dream
Nothing more, Nothing less
than a beautiful view.
